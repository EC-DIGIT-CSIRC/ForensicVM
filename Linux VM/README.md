# Introduction 

The Forensic Linux VM Template project contains a bash script which is used to generate an bootable ISO image of Ubuntu 16.04

The bash script requires the Repository server to be available.

# Pre-requisite

* 1) A VM/System with a Ubuntu 16.04 installed on it (Or from a live Ubuntu 16.04 CD)
* 2) The VM/System needs a network connection to the LAN
* /!\ DO NOT CONNECT THE SYSTEM TO THE INTERNET /!\
* 3) The Repository must be online and available
* 4) You will need a standard ISO image of Ubuntu 16.04 on the system which will run the Bash script
