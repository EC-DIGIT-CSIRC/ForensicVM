# Introduction 

The Forensic Linux Live CD project contains a bash script which is used to generate an bootable ISO image of Ubuntu 16.04

There are two versions of the bash scripts:

* The online version, which will work with by installing the tools directly from the internet
* The offline version, which will require a local repository server containing all the tools to be installed on the VM.

# Pre-requisite

* 1) A VM/System with a Ubuntu 16.04 installed on it (Or from a live Ubuntu 16.04 CD)
* 2) The VM/System needs a network connection to the LAN
* For the online version of the script, the VM/System will need an internet access
* For the offline version of the script, the VM/System doesn't need any internet access
* 3) You will need a standard ISO image of Ubuntu 16.04 on the system which will run the Bash script
